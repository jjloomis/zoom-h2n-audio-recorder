# Recording audio \(phone call\)

With your phone set to Speaker, you can use a Zoom to record the audio of a phone call. This method uses clever mic positioning to ensure your portion of the call and that of the caller's is recorded at an optimum audio level.

1. See image below. This is how the Zoom should be positioned relative to your phone. \(**Note**: The phone's earpiece is about 2 inches away from Zoom's **Record** button.\) 
2. Plug earbuds into** **the** Line Out** jack on the Zoom.
3. Plug earbuds into your ears.
4. Press the **Record** button once. The **red record light** will turn on. You are recording.
5. Set to your phone **Speaker **when you make your call**. **
6. When you talk during the call, lean in so you're about 8 inches away from the Zoom's mic and about 4 inches away from your phone's mic. This will ensure your portion of the call is recorded at an optimum audio level. \(The Zoom's [Automatic Gain Control](/applying-automatic-gain-control.md) will help record the caller's portion of the call at an optimum audio level.\)
7. When you're finished recording, press the **Record** button again. The **red record light** will shut off.
